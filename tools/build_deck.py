"""Build an Anki-importable deck from a curated card list.

Each card targets the C1 -> C2 jump: advanced lexis, dense verb/grammar
constructions, and discourse connectors that elevate written English.
All back content is in English on purpose (monolingual loop = transfer).

Run:  python tools/build_deck.py
